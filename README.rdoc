= acts_as_featured

Feature your models on your site's special spots.

(Tested only on Rails 2.3.2 as of now)

== Setup

Install the plugin:

	script/plugin install git://github.com/sgt/acts_as_featured.git
	
Add the features table to your database:

	script/generate acts_as_featured_migration
	rake db:migrate

== Usage

In the model:

	class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
		acts_as_featured
	end

Assigning models to feature spots:

	article = Article.create(:subject=>'foo', :body=>'bar')
	
	# Assign the article to a feature spot (removes previous)
	article.feature_at! :top_right_spot

Getting the featured object:

	@article = Article.featured_at :top_right_spot

Or directly in the view:

	<% feature :top_spot do |f| %>
		<%= link_to f, f.name %>
	<% end %>
